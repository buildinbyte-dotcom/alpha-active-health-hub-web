### **Task: Competitor Analysis & Design Refinement**

**Context:**
We have generated the initial `website_design.md` for **Alpha Active Health**. Now, we need to benchmark against top-tier competitors to refine our layout, UX, and feature set.

**Objective:**
Analyze the following three reference websites to extract high-value design patterns, content structures, and trust-building elements. Use these insights to upgrade our current plan in `website_design.md`.

**Reference Websites:**
1.  `https://hollywoodrheumatology.com.au/`
2.  `https://www.drjeremywang.com.au/`
3.  `https://drdenisetong.com.au/`

**Step 1: Comparative Analysis (Use MCP Tools)**
Traverse these sites and analyze them for the following specific elements:
* **Navigation Structure:** How do they group complex medical services? Is it easy for seniors to use?
* **Trust Signals:** How do they display accreditations, doctor bios, and patient testimonials?
* **Patient Education:** How are they presenting disease information (Arthritis, Lupus, etc.)? Is it a blog, a glossary, or downloadable PDFs?
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Note the use of whitespace, font sizes, and color to guide the eye.

**Step 2: Synthesis & Filtering (Critical Step)**
* **Be Selective:** Do **not** blindly copy sections. Only adopt features that are relevant to a hybrid **Rheumatology + Physiotherapy** practice with a focus on **Wellness Products**.
* **Be Creative:** If you see a good feature (e.g., a "referral form"), think about how we can make it better or more modern for our specific use case.
* **Identify Gaps:** What are these competitors *missing* that we can do better? (e.g., none of them might have a curated "Wellness Store" — how does that fit into the layout without looking out of place?)

**Step 3: Actionable Updates**
Based on your findings, **update the `website_design.md` file**.
* **Refine the Sitemap:** If you found a better way to organize the menu.
* **Enhance Component Descriptions:** Add details to components (e.g., "Add a 'What to Expect' timeline section on the New Patients page, inspired by Dr. Wang's site").
* **Visual Notes:** Add specific notes on color usage or accessibility features observed in the examples.

**Output:**
1.  Provide a brief summary of **"Key Takeaways"** from the competitor analysis.
2.  **Update `website_design.md`** with the refined structure and improved component definitions.
